## Why

The project currently has no automated release process. Version tags exist (`v0.1.1`, `v0.1.2`, `v0.1.3`) but there are no GitHub Releases, no changelog, and no CI/CD workflows at all. When a tag is pushed, nothing happens. Developers and users have no way to see what changed between versions without reading raw commit history. Adding automatic release generation when tags are pushed gives the project a visible release history with generated changelogs, using git-cliff configured for the project's non-conventional commit style (imperative mood, no prefixes).

## What Changes

- Add a `cliff.toml` configuration that uses regex-based commit parsers to categorize the project's imperative-mood commit messages (e.g., "Add ..." as additions, "Fix ..." as fixes, "Remove ..." as removals)
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on version tag pushes (`v*`), runs git-cliff to generate a changelog for the tagged version, and creates a GitHub Release with the generated notes
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` to the repository root, generated by git-cliff from existing commit history

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `auto-release`: Covers the GitHub Actions workflow triggered by tag pushes, git-cliff configuration for non-conventional commit parsing, GitHub Release creation, and changelog generation

### Modified Capabilities

(none)

## Impact

- **New files**: `cliff.toml` (git-cliff config), `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Actions workflow), `CHANGELOG.md` (generated changelog)
- **Dependencies**: git-cliff (used via GitHub Action `orhun/git-cliff-action`, no local install required)
- **Systems**: GitHub Actions (new), GitHub Releases (new)
- **Existing code**: No changes to existing source code, specs, or agent definitions
