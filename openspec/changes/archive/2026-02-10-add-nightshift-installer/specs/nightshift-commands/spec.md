## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Command files are installer-generated
The system SHALL treat all six Nightshift slash command files as installer-generated artifacts rather than manually-committed source files. Each command file SHALL be written by `nightshift init` and regenerated by `nightshift update` from templates bundled in the CLI package.

#### Scenario: Commands are available after init
- **WHEN** a user runs `nightshift init` in a fresh project and then opens OpenCode
- **THEN** all six Nightshift slash commands SHALL be available: `/nightshift-create`, `/nightshift-start`, `/nightshift-archive`, `/nightshift-add-task`, `/nightshift-test-task`, `/nightshift-update-table`

#### Scenario: Commands match current behavior after generation
- **WHEN** command files are generated by the installer
- **THEN** the generated command files SHALL produce identical behavior to the current manually-committed command files
