## Why

Nightshift currently has no installer. Users must clone the repository and manually copy files into the right directories. This is fragile, undocumented, and doesn't scale if Nightshift is adopted as a reusable framework across multiple projects (similar to how OpenSpec is used). An installer modeled after OpenSpec's `openspec init` / `openspec update` pattern would provide a proper setup experience: a CLI command that scaffolds the required directory structure, generates agent and command files, and configures the host project for Nightshift.

## What Changes

- Add a `nightshift init` CLI command that scaffolds Nightshift into any OpenCode project (creates `.nightshift/`, `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/command/`, and merges the `opencode.jsonc` agent block)
- Add a `nightshift update` CLI command that regenerates agent definitions and command files after upgrading the Nightshift CLI
- Package Nightshift as an npm-installable CLI (`npm install -g nightshift` or similar) with a `bin` entry point
- Create a TypeScript CLI application using `commander` for argument parsing, modeled after OpenSpec's CLI architecture
- Support non-interactive mode (`--force`, `--yes` flags) for scripted/CI usage
- Detect existing Nightshift installations and handle upgrades gracefully (don't overwrite user customizations in `opencode.jsonc`)

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `nightshift-installer`: Covers the `nightshift init` and `nightshift update` CLI commands, including directory scaffolding, file generation, conflict detection, and upgrade handling. Also covers the npm package structure (`package.json`, `bin/`, `src/`, `dist/`) required to distribute Nightshift as a global CLI tool.

### Modified Capabilities
- `nightshift-commands`: The existing six slash commands (`.opencode/command/nightshift-*.md`) will become generated artifacts that the installer writes during `nightshift init`, rather than manually-committed files. The command behavior specifications remain unchanged; only the delivery mechanism changes.

## Impact

- **New files**: `package.json` (root), `bin/nightshift.js`, `src/` directory with CLI source (TypeScript), `build.js` or `tsconfig.json` for build tooling
- **Repository structure change**: The committed `.opencode/agent/*.md` and `.opencode/command/nightshift-*.md` files become generated outputs of the installer rather than manually-maintained source files. They may still be committed to the repo for this project, but in target projects they would be gitignored and regenerated by `nightshift update`.
- **Dependencies**: `commander`, `chalk`, `ora` (matching OpenSpec's dependency choices for consistency), plus `typescript` and build tooling as dev dependencies
- **Build system**: Requires a build step (`pnpm build` or `bun build`) to compile TypeScript to JavaScript before publishing
- **npm registry**: The package must be published to npm for global installation to work
- **Existing users**: Current users of the cloned repo will need to run `nightshift init` to migrate, or continue using the repo as-is (backward compatible since the committed files still work)
